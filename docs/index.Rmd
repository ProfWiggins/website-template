WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO DO:

1. Convert all these to Rmd.
2. Include the header as a child document.
3. Offer a one-page web site, which is just an `.md` file.
4. Edit the project for workshop2018 to add a page for each locale. 
5. Add hub leaders to the GitHub site.
    - tell them just to edit their own page or create pages in that directory. 
    - they should commit/pull/push frequently.


ERASE THE ABOVE WHEN YOU GET TO IT.

```{r child="header.md"}
```

This is a simple website where every document is a simple text file. 

* It consists of several documents (as many or few as you want), all of which can written with Markdown syntax. Thus, every document's names ends with the `.md` suffix.
* There's an optional horizontal menu just below the title. 
    - You can change the *names* of the menu items by editing the text in the *square brackets*. 
    - You can change the *target* file for the menu item by editing the name of the file in the *parentheses*.
    - You can add or delete items from the menu line just by adding or removing new elements with the link structure: `[Menu item name](menu_item_file.md)`.
* You can delete or modify any element, as you like, add new pages.
* If you become familiar with RStudio, and can edit Rmd files, there's another template available [here](github.com/StatPREP/Rmd-website-template) which will let you do
